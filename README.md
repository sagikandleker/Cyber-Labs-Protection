The simulator constitutes practical training for cyber teams who deal with cyber warfare and defense, SOC information security experts, and network management and administrators. In hands-on training exercises, participants encounter advanced attack scenarios in a realistic and secure environment, under the guidance of our cyber experts.

In addition to practical expertise, training increases organizational efficiency for resolving incidents, improves self-confidence, and benefits the team’s work. The simulator enables comprehensive training for cyber security at various levels on IT and SCADA networks, and in a variety of operating systems – Windows, Linux and more.

This training is designed to prepare and accustom the trainees in encountering complex cyber incidents, thus strengthening and increasing the efficiency of the defense array in the cyber field, as they experience situations taken from reality without the risks that are likely to occur in real-life conditions.
